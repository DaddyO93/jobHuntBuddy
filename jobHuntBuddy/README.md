# jobHuntBuddy
An app to help keep track through the job hunt process. Track your contact people, positions applied to, and companies you are considering.

Sure, I could have used a spreadsheet, but this was more fun to build!

Built with the Django framework with Python, HTML, and CSS, using Bootstrap to make it look better. 

If you are in the process of hunting for a job, feel free to use this once it's done.
